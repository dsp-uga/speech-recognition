young fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire there befell an anxious interview mistress fitzooth arguing for and against the squire's project in a breath most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel if for a whim you beggar yourself i cannot stay you never that sir he had said he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm tis late and i go myself within a short space dismiss your squire robin and bid me good e e n as any in england i would say said gamewell proudly that is in his day yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gamewell's chamber presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step will cried he softly and stuteley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once in answer we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window rest and be still until i warn you the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that warrenton had fulfilled his mission they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground stuteley was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton's save me masters but you startled me rarely cried he waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him truly such a horse should be worth much in nottingham fair nay nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think geoffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them his tones rang pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell he began a confused complaint against the wizard who had vanished behind the curtain on the left give not so earnest a mind to these mummeries child a golden fortune and a happy life he was like unto my father in a way and yet was not my father also there was a stripling page who turned into a maid this was so sweet a lady sir and in some manner i do think she died but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came sister nell do you hear these marvels take your place and let us see what the crystal can show to you like as not young master though i am an old man forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss but master will who peeped out first needed no more than one glance he gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the squire and mistress fitzooth to the rear of the tent cries of a nottingham a nottingham before them fled the stroller and his three sons capless and terrified what is the tumult and rioting cried out the squire authoritatively and he blew twice on a silver whistle which hung at his belt nay we refused their request most politely most noble said the little stroller and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us i could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing his duty as one of cumberland's sons so i did push this fellow it is enough said george gamewell sharply and he turned upon the crowd shame on you citizens cried he i blush for my fellows of nottingham surely we can submit with good grace tis fine for you to talk old man answered the lean sullen apprentice but i wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout spoke the squire losing all patience and it was to you that i gave another purse in consolation come to me men here here he raised his voice still louder the strollers took their part in it with hearty zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valiantly did these two comport themselves the head and chief of the riot the nottingham apprentice with clenched fists threatened montfichet the squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself now be silent on your lives he began but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout silence you knave cried montfichet he felt for and found the wizard's black cloth the squire was quite out of breath thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout a montfichet a montfichet gamewell to the rescue taking advantage of this the squire's few men redoubled their efforts and encouraged by robin's and the little stroller's cries fought their way to him george montfichet will never forget this day what is your name lording asked the little stroller presently and mine is will stuteley shall we be comrades right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin i like you will you are the second will that i have met and liked within two days is there a sign in that montfichet called out for robin to give him an arm friends said montfichet faintly to the wrestlers bear us escort so far as the sheriff's house it will not be safe for you to stay here now pray follow us with mine and my lord sheriff's men nottingham castle was reached and admittance was demanded master monceux the sheriff of nottingham was mightily put about when told of the rioting and henry might return to england at any moment have your will child if the boy also wills it montfichet answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm beg me a room of the sheriff child quickly but who is this fellow plucking at your sleeve he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the sheriff's daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of montfichet robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices the wine did certainly bring back the color to the squire's cheeks these escapades are not for old gamewell lad his day has come to twilight no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness you are a worthy leech will presently whispered robin the wine has worked a marvel ay and show you some pretty tricks rodolfo and his companions with their faces muffled in their cloaks stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant maid finally the one party went off exulting and the other was left in desolation and woe rodolfo arrived at his own house without any impediment and leocadia's parents reached theirs heart broken and despairing meanwhile rodolfo had leocadia safe in his custody and in his own apartment mother dear father do you hear me it is the only amends i ask of you for the wrong you have done me she found the door but it was locked outside she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hangings in the room she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by her tears he had only carried her half way towards his house and then let her go choking with emotion leocadi made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them thus did this humane and right minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe her feelings one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot this truth which i have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in state's prison as a consequence of his rash act i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made fairview was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk i'm running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly oh say that's different observed markham altering his demeanor may we see gates at once asked kenneth they followed the jailer along a succession of passages sometimes i'm that yearning for a smoke i'm nearly crazy an i dunno which is worst dyin one way or another he unlocked the door and called here's visitors tom worse tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily miss de graf said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a bench here a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident then rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern i was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved them a heavy loss one day i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marshall never even thanked me it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth i'm going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir it won't be much but i'm grateful to find a friend they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office i've seen lots of that kind in my day and it ruins a man's disposition he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated some girl has been here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her i'm not electioneering just now and he deserves a term in state's prison it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance you're foolish why should you do all this i have my own reasons mister marshall give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates beth uneasy at his silence nudged him there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars the weak kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or another secured from the opposition the democratic committee figured out a way to do this under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted foreseeing great success for their fete we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maids she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was the mistress here and beth was her especial favorite the housekeeper led the way and beth followed for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plain black gown with white apron and cap then she gave a little laugh and replied no miss beth i'm elizabeth parsons but it can't be protested the girl i attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where is your home for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance her eyes wandered to the maid's hands however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely will you leave me alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock o life of this our spring why fades the lotus of the water why fade these children of the spring like the doves voice like transient day like music in the air ah and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time why should the mistress of the vales of har utter a sigh she ceasd and smild in tears then sat down in her silver shrine and why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air descend o little cloud and hover before the eyes of thel i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice the cloud then shewd his golden head and his bright form emerg'd and fearest thou because i vanish and am seen no more till we arise link'd in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lillys leaf and the bright cloud saild on to find his partner in the vale image of weakness art thou but a worm i see they lay helpless and naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mothers smiles and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot or an eye of gifts and graces showring fruits and coined gold why a tongue impress'd with honey from every wind why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game alas i have grieved so i am hard to love open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god has willed a still renewable fear o love o troth and love be false if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star foretold slow to world greetings quick with its o list when the angels speak a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dost good mussulmans and giaours throw kerchiefs at a smile and have no ruth for any weeping but thou art not such a lover my beloved thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late i thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree but this was what the tree could not bear to hear oh that made him so angry in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees have you not met them anywhere rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams and then what happens then i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh were i but already on the cart were i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence yes then something better something still grander will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me something better something still grander must follow but what rejoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight rejoice in thy own fresh youth but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the birds the departure was not at all agreeable the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it this evening they all said how it will shine this evening perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me it blazed up famously help help cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire a story a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree but i shall tell only one story humpy dumpy fell downstairs and yet he married the princess thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in what's the meaning of this thought the tree and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie tis now winter out of doors thought the tree how kind man is after all if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches i am by no means old said the fir tree there's many a one considerably older than i am they were so extremely curious i know no such place said the tree and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related yes in reality those were happy times who is humpy dumpy asked the mice only that one answered the tree it is a very stupid story don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles can't you tell any larder stories no said the tree then good bye said the rats and they went home now that too is over why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft but it was not the fir tree that they meant it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine in the court yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it sighed so deeply however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company i have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
