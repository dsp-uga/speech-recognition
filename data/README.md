This is the folder for storing the datasets. One folder under is for DASS (The Digital Archive of the Southern Speech. Audio data and metadata are downloadable from http://www.lap.uga.edu/Projects/DASS/), and the other is LibriSpeech (from http://www.openslr.org/12/).

Due to the large size of the files, we did not upload the .wav files in this folder. But here is how this folder is structured:

--data (i.e. HERE)

-----DASS

----------Folder1 (sentence-level-segmented wav files inside)

----------Folder2 (sentence-level-segmented wav files inside)

-----LibriSpeech

----------Speaker1

---------------Speaker1Folder1 (sentence-level-segmented wav files inside)

----------------Speaker1Folder2 (sentence-level-segmented wav files inside)

----------Speaker2

---------------Speaker2Folder1 (sentence-level-segmented wav files inside)

----------------Speaker2Folder2 (sentence-level-segmented wav files inside)

...
so on and so forth. If you have any questions about the data and the structure, please contact me at jeremy.shi@uga.edu.
